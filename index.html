            <ul>
                <li><strong>2014</strong> - A massive, white orb entered our solar system, headed for Earth. It stopped
                    at several of our neighboring planets, terraforming them so that they became habitable for humans.
                    This orb, which humans dubbed "the Traveler," was believed to be sentient. It was clearly benevolent
                    as well, but everything about it was — and still is — a mystery. Who or what made it? Why did it
                    come to Earth? Why did it help us? These mysteries are at the core of the Destiny saga..</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2060s</strong> - The Traveler arrived at Earth, ushering in a Golden Age for humanity. The
                    Traveler gave us a giant upgrade, our technology and understanding of science growing exponentially.
                    It was such a leap forward that we were able to skip centuries ahead of our natural development.
                    Lifespans tripled, and humans spread to Mars, Venus, Mercury, Earth's moon, and even Jupiter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2400s</strong> - Several hundred years into the Golden Age, an enemy of the Traveler called
                    the Darkness invaded our solar system. The über-powerful Darkness — a kind of living, expanding
                    biomatter that kills, destroys, or defiles everything it touches — brought about "the Collapse," the
                    official end of the Golden Age and very nearly the extinction of mankind. Only the power of the
                    Traveler was able to drive back the Darkness and save the remnants of humanity, but the Traveler had
                    to sacrifice itself in the process.

            <img src=https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/destiny_gamepedia/thumb/0/0c/Gateway.png/1200px-Gateway.png

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A Dark Age began as humans were scattered and lost across the surface of the Earth, and the colonies
                    on Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury were snuffed out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As it went dormant, the Traveler passed on some of its power to individuals who would come to be
                    known as Guardians. In Destiny and Destiny 2, you play as one of these Guardians. These noble
                    soldiers possess unique powers, drawing upon the Traveler's power, called "Light." (Think: the
                    Force, if it originated from a single source.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Guardians are, believe it or not, made up of more than just humans. Human beings are just one of the
                    three species that make up the Guardians. There's also the Awoken, a species descended from humans
                    who who tried to escape to deep space during the Collapse. A shockwave hit them, destroying their
                    fleet and inexplicably changing them into elf-like, aloof beings with blue/gray skin. They
                    established their own monarchical society in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, calling it
                    "the Reef."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then there are the EXOs, highly advanced, human-like androids. Their origins are almost as
                    mysterious as the Awoken, but it's known that they were built during the Golden Age, probably to
                    fight alien robots called the Vex, who'd been discovered on Venus. During the Collapse, the Traveler
                    imbued EXOs with sentience, personalities, and for lack of a better word, life. That's one version
                    of the EXOs' origin, anyway. Another story suggests that every EXO is a Golden Age human who
                    transferred his or her consciousness into a machine in an attempt to live forever.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was the Guardians who gathered and led what remained of mankind, while various alien races — all
                    nefarious and possibly under some degree of the Darkness' influence — converged on our solar system
                    and began plundering, destroying, and trying to discover the Traveler's secrets. The bug-like Hive
                    set up shop mostly on the moon, digging deep tunnels and building temples underground. The Vex had
                    already claimed a large portion of Venus centuries ago and soon annexed Mercury, turning it into a
                    massive machine computer. The burly warriors of a savage military force called the Cabal seized most
                    of Mars. The Fallen, a group of vicious scavenger pirates, spread out across all of these worlds.

                <li>
                    <strong>2450s</strong> - The last of humanity discovered the dormant Traveler, finding it floating
                    above land that used to be part of Russia. Everyone converged there beneath the Traveler's
                    protection and built the Last City, a walled structure and our one remaining safe haven. For more
                    than 200 years, Guardians protected the City from continued attempts by the various alien races to
                    destroy it and gain control of the Traveler.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2715</strong> - Destiny begins and you (a new Guardian) are a dead human, EXO, or Awoken,
                    reanimated by the Traveler's Light. Indoctrinated into the "Vanguard," the command structure that
                    oversees the Guardians, you're whisked away to the Tower, the headquarters of the Vanguard and the
                    only home Guardians have. Every Guardian's spaceship docks at the Tower for maintenance and repairs,
                    after which the Guardian flies off to another location on Earth or one of the other planets in the
                    solar system, where alien baddies (and tons of in-game loot) await.

                    Guardians fall into one of three classes: Hunters, Warlocks, or Titans. Each class has unique
                    strengths, varying subclasses, and a representative among the Vanguard leadership.

                    The storyline of the first game was spotty and confusing, a ramshackle mess that was thrown together
                    without much care or concern. It involved your Guardian learning the ropes, visiting each of the
                    game's worlds, and trying to find a way to help the Traveler heal by destroying a Vex stronghold
                    called the Black Garden.

                    sent on a series of missions to systematically take out Crota's generals before turning to the big
                    guy himself. His death cry would echo across the universe, awakening an even worse enemy.

                    A while back, the queen of the Awoken, Mara Sov, subdued a clan of Fallen called the House of
                    Wolves, and made them swear allegiance to her. The House of Wolves became loyal servants to the
                    queen, but as this second DLC campaign begins, it's revealed that the queen's Fallen have revolted,
                    escaping the Reef to unite all of the Fallen against the Awoken and the Guardians.

                    The reclusive Awoken in the Reef welcome the Guardians to visit and trade and take on missions for
                    the queen, for the first time ever. Guardians are charged with hunting down the Fallen who led the
                    House of Wolves' insurrection, to exact vengeance on him and his followers for the queen.

            <ul>
                <li>A big, bad enemy named Oryx (Crota's pissed off dad who heard the aforementioned death cry)
                    highlighted the campaign, which saw circumstances throughout the solar system change pretty
                    drastically, along with interface and gameplay mechanics tweaked for the better. It also marked a
                    noticeable improvement to the game's writing, with main characters getting better dialogue and more
                    interesting personalities.

                    Oryx, a powerful king among the Hive, brings a massive Dreadnaught to Saturn and a whole new army
                    for the Guardians to fight: the Taken. These are corrupted and more powerful versions of the Fallen,
                    Hive, Vex, and Cabal enemies players already knew. Mara Sov launches a first wave attack against
                    Oryx, but her entire fleet is wiped out and she's presumed dead (but may have survived).
                    After a mission of discovery to Mars' moon Phobos, the Guardians learn of Oryx and his ability to
                    corrupt alien species, bringing them under his thrall. The interior of Oryx's Dreadnaught becomes a
                    huge new area for players to explore and fight, and the centerpiece of the campaign's climax. Taking
                    on Oryx has to wait until a super-weapon on the Dreadnaught can be neutralized, but after a series
                    of surprisingly fun missions, Guardians finally defeat Oryx for good.

                <li> The highly satisfying exploration of a forgotten piece of Guardian lore: the Iron Lords. These
                    elite warriors were precursors to the Guardians, protecting what was left of humanity before there
                    was a Last City. A century before the events of Destiny, the Iron Lords were mostly lost in a
                    conflict to contain a man-made, self-replicating nano technology called SIVA. Designed as a kind of
                    programmable matter, SIVA soon became more akin to a computer virus that could affect and infect
                    anything, including living beings. In the living, SIVA was like a super-powered steroid, massively
                    ramping up the strength and durability of anything it infected. The Iron Lords managed to contain
                    SIVA — at the cost of their own lives.
                    When SIVA is discovered in current times by the Fallen, they use it to make themselves more
                    powerful. Guardians are called upon to become new Iron Lords to take on the new SIVA-ized Fallen,
                    who are spreading through an area on Earth called the Plaguelands.
